                <H2>Computers and Education</h2>
                    <p>Stereotypes prevent females and other minorities from pursuing an education and a career in Computer Science (CS). Central to broadening the CS pipeline is identifying and debunking stereotypes about computer scientists, especially stereotypes among those who serve as role models for young children, such as early childhood educators. This mixed methods study examined which CS stereotypes female early childhood preservice teachers hold. Analysis of the data collected from 70 preservice teachers revealed stereotypes about computer scientists' appearance, race/ethnicity, cognitive skills, and work preferences. Specifically, participants see computer scientists as intelligent and overworked White individuals who wear glasses. Findings also showed participants' counter-stereotypical notions about computer scientists’ gender and social skills. Particularly, computer scientists were portrayed as collaborative professionals who could be from either gender. CS has been recurrently described in the literature as a male-dominant field, so findings from this study suggest that females may be starting to see themselves or other females in CS roles. Additionally, the emergence of both stereotypical and counter-stereotypical notions speaks to the fact that different conceptions can be formed based on prior experience and exposure to CS role models. As implications for practice and future research, these findings emphasize the importance of addressing CS stereotypes within teacher education programs, as well as preparing future teachers who can pedagogically design and offer CS education to young children in inclusive ways.</p>

                        <p>Computer Science (CS) stereotypes promote the mindset that nerdy White males who have a high IQ and are technology enthusiasts are the ones to succeed in the field, leading to gender and racial disparities. This quasi-experimental study investigated if exposing teacher candidates to a stereotypical vs. counter-stereotypical CS role model affects their stereotypes and attitudes toward teaching CS. Participants exposed to a counter-stereotypical role model reported a statistically significant decrease in stereotypes about social skills, and slightly weaker stereotypes about appearance, cognitive skills, and work preferences. Participants exposed to a stereotypical role model reported no changes in stereotypes. Participants in both groups showed increasingly positive attitudes toward teaching CS. Implications for CS teacher education are discussed.</p>

                <H2>Graduation with Leadership Distinction: Research</h2>
                    <p>The portfolio consists of 5 parts (about me, three key insights, and a leadership section). The first part is about me which gives a little information about who I am and how I came to complete the GLD.  The rest of the portfolio will consist of 3 key insights (Your Future is Not Pre-determined, The Importance of Words, and Your Effects on Others). Your Future is Not Pre-determined explains the reasons why I joined Dr. V's researching on computer science stereotypes and what I learned from the process. The Importance of Words covers the lessons I learned from Technical Writing and the opportunities that I gained from the class. Finally, Your Effects on Others details how I used the results from Dr. V’s research to try and help other minorities in my computer science classroom. On top of my experiences, I will thoroughly explain what I took away from each and how they changed me in the process. The leadership tab will take a problem relating to the topic discussed in your effects on others and will detail a solution for that problem.</p>

                    <H2>Graduation with Leadership Distinction: Professional and Civic Engagement</h2>
                        <p>The portfolio consists of 5 parts (about me, three key insights, and a leadership section). The first part is a reflection of who I am and how I got to where I was when I completed the GLD.  I have several key insights (being the missing piece, creating a space for all, and dressing for the part) that highlight a few of these experiences. Being the missing piece focuses on my experience as a peer tutor, why I joined the student success, and my lessons along the way.  Creating a space for all touches on lessons I learned in my Issues and Trends in Teaching and Learning class and how I applied those lessons in the RM roll. Lastly, dressing for the part talks about how I discovered that how I dressed for school and work affected my mood throughout the day. On top of my experiences, I will thoroughly explain what I took away from each and how they changed me in the process. The leadership tab will take a problem relating to the topic discussed in creating a space for all and will detail a solution for that problem.</p>
