        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I have accumilated the projects and assignments I have had and uploaded their respective codes to github. Each class focused on a different topic, language, and/or skill so the page exemplifies everything I have learned and accomplished in my classes. This page is alo a repository of links to each class.</p>

        <h2>Publications and Honors</h2>
        <p>Due to the research I praticpated in during my collgeiate years, I have several publications in varying journals. The publications focus on the research I did with Dr. Lima De vascalonas, focusing on identifying compter science steryotypes in early education majors. On top of my publications, I have earned two honors (Graduation with Leadership distniction in Resarch and Profesional and Civic Engagment). One requirment to complete the honor is to assemble a portfolio. Both portfolio exemplify the beyond the classroom experiences I underwent during my undergrad, and include a reflection of what I have learned. This page showcases the publications and honors I have earned.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I have worked with three different professors with three different focuses: Dr. Lima de Vascalones (focusing on identifying computer science steryotypes in early education majors), Dr. Voulgaris (working on a self positioning platform for aquatic data collectio), Dr. Rekleitis (working in the autonomous field robotics labs). This page exemplifies the work I did with each professor and project. </p>
