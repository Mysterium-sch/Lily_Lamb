                        <p>I am doing work in the autonomous field robotic labs working on a variety of projects. One of my first projects was configuring a jetson-nano with Ubuntu 20.04 and installing Ros1 and Ros2.</p>

                        <h2>Dr. Voulagaris</h2>
                        <h2>May 2022 - December 2022</h2>
                        <p>This specific project was funded by the Magellan Grant. The project worked to develop an aquatic autonomous platform for station keeping/data collection. My main role on the project was to develop and modify Ardupiolt software for the platform.</p>
                        <p>During the first few stages of testing, we discovered that there was a major flaw with the pre-programmed system. The platform tended to constantly jerk left and right, creating large amounts of disturbance in the water. The disturbance in the water caused errors during data collection, so we needed a way to decrease the jerkiness. After a few weeks of discussion, and some research on my part we came up with a plan.</p>
                        <p>The plan I devised was to modify the pre-existing code and upload the software to the file. The new code would create a relatively large amount of time where the robot would not run the motors and decrease the amount of time the robot would turn left and right. These changes (proposed by me) would theoretically solve all the problems during initial testing. However, even though in theory the main problem would be solved, I suggested that we continue with testing for the original code. Testing is a lengthy process and so would coding the new firmware. I wanted to complete testing for the original code so that we could run an analysis with the changed code. It took a few weeks, but I finally figured out how to change and upload the new firmware. After testing the new code, it was quickly determined that the modified code performed better than the original. Shortly after this discovery, the platform ran through testing and was successfully tested in the ocean: marking the end of the project.</p>

                <h2>Dr. Vasconcelos (Dr. V)</h2>
                    <h2>September 2020 - May 2023</h2>
                    <p>I spent my freshmen, sophomore, and Junior years of my undergrad working with Dr. V. Our work focused on identifying computer science stereotypes in different groups. My main research with Dr. V worked to identify computer science stereotypes in early education majors. The idea behind the study is that teachers have a large impact on students, and is it possible that teachers are passing these stereotypes onto children? During the study, I assisted with literature collection and data processing. I helped with the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data. I also assisted Dr. V with a discussion of results and what they could mean</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, before I concluded working with Dr. V to focus on robotic work, I helped with several potential studies that included computer science stereotypes on middle school and high school students as well as transgender individuals. I have two papers published with Dr. V, which can be found in the publication section.</p>
